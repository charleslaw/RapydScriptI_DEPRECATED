The asteroids game was originally written as a Pyjs (formally Pyjamas) example. With some relatively minor changes, the code was ported over to RapydScript. The RapydScript verion has the full functionality of the game but with a significantly smaller footprint. The important metrics from our perspective are:

	Download Size: 18 kb   vs 1200 kb
	Download Time: 1.3 sec vs  17 sec
	LOC:             700   vs   32900

It is also worth noting that there are multiple cache files generated for Pyjs so the footprint on the server is even larger.
